# Snake-Game
The classic snake done in C++.
The library conio.h is used to take input from user. The jpg file shows the gameplay. If you would like to use the code to play adjust the speed by changing the number inside the Sleep function. My sister did not like the game because it was too fast for her so I slowed it down. Using Sleep(80); to Sleep(100); is about the correct speed. Another factor as well is your processor. Adjust to make it work smoothly for your pc.
I will redo this game in summer 2021 in pygame, there is a lot of improvements to be done
