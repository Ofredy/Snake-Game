# Snake-Game
The classic snake done in C++.
The library conio.h is used to take input from user. The jpg file shows the gameplay. If you would like to use adjust the speed by changing the number inside the sleep function. My sister did not like the game becuase it was too fast for her so I slowed it down. Using sleep(80); to sleep(100); is about the correct speed. Another factor as is well is your processor. Adjust as well to make it work smoothly for your pc.
I will redo this game in summer 2021 in pygame, there is a lot of improvements to be done
